 Specifics:

Please start with the login class and use the credentials below to login. It will lead you to the fireworks.

 1. To use this Application, you have to enter a login username and password. They are as follows:
 	Username: "username"
 	Password: "password"  //password is case sensitive
 
 2. The whole App is in 1 window. The Top Panel contains controls for colour and type of Fireworks. The Launch button renders the fireworks, 
 	while the refresh button, cleans the scene. This allows for users to specify multiple shots without creating a separate control panel.
 	The down-side is refreshing the scene clears the entire canvas and cannot be undone.
 	
 3. We have made 9 different types of Fireworks and given them names to make it interesting. 
 
 4. The main frame has a Border Layout with 3 regions - North, Centre and South. 
	The North region contains the panel “topPanel” which has a Box Layout with respect to the Y-axis. ‘topPanel’ contains 2 inner panels - 	“companyName” panel, which has flow layout; and “colorAndType”, which has Box layout with respect to X-axis. 
	The centre panel just has the fireworks. 
	The south panel contains the bottom bar which has box layout with respect to X-Axis.
 
 5. We have added to two values for colour - Primary and Secondary, for a more fun way to paint the fireworks. Choosing a primary colour is mandatory. The choice of having a secondary colour is left to the user.
 
 6. We have also allowed time to be a variable defined by the user. 

 7. If the inputted setting sets off the firework so high or low that it goes out of the frame, then the firework does not explode and a message is displayed in the top of the frame, instead of the welcome message, saying “Out of Bounds”. The user can change the inputs such that the fireworks fit the frame and continue enjoying them after receiving the out of bounds message.

 8. The size of the frame can be increased using the maximise button on the top left of the window. All setting in the program will adjust accordingly.


Extra Credit:

1. Login Panel: There is a login panel, which gives you  access to the fireworks. The password shows in bullets instead of text.

2. Colour choice: The user can choose whether he/she wants his/her fireworks to be single or double coloured. A various list of colours in provided to choose from.

3. Multiple fireworks: There are 9 very interesting and dinstict fireworks for the user to choose from.

4. Out of Bounds: The user is prompted if the firework goes out of bounds and is given the opportunity to reset the settings and enjoy the fireworks of his/her choice.
